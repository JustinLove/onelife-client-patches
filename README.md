## Wondible's One Hour One Life Client Patches

I had a [fork](https://github.com/JustinLove/OneLife) of the [git repo](https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife), but felt like the several features could get a bit muddled all in one, and buried behind mainline changes and merges.

I'm currently using [Stacked Git](http://procode.org/stgit/) (stgit) to manage patches, although it seems to create a lot of noise in the commit graph.

Importing all of these patches would be:

`stg import --series onelife-client-patches/series`
